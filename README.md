# SQLProject-from-orders-to-insights üçΩÔ∏è
A hands-on SQL project for practicing data cleaning, joins, and analysis using restaurant order data.

## üß† The Situation  
You've just been hired as a **Data Analyst** for **Taste of the World Caf√©**, a restaurant known for its diverse menu offerings and generous portions.  
The caf√© recently rolled out a brand-new menu at the start of the year ‚Äî and management wants to know how things are going.  

My job? To dig into the data and uncover what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not, and what customers really love most.  

---

## üìã The Assignment  
The Taste of the World Caf√© debuted a new menu, and now it‚Äôs time to measure its impact.  
I‚Äôve been asked to dive into the customer order data to answer key questions like:  

- Which menu items are performing well (and which are not)?  
- Who are the top customers?  
- What are their favorite dishes?  

---

## üéØ The Objectives  
1. **Explore the `menu_items` table** to get an overview of what‚Äôs on the new menu.  
2. **Explore the `order_details` table** to understand what kind of data has been collected.  
3. **Combine both tables** to see how customers are reacting to the new menu items ‚Äî what‚Äôs selling, what‚Äôs not, and who‚Äôs ordering what.

## üß© Tools Used  
- **SQL** for querying and analysis  
- **MySQL**
- **YouTube Project Reference:** *Data Analyst Portfolio Project ‚Äì Restaurant Order Analysis in SQL (with Solutions)*

## üßπ Data Cleaning Process  

When I first connected to MySQL, I created a new connection named **`restaurant_db`** and imported three CSV files:
- `menu_items`
- `order_details`
- `restaurant_db_data_dictionary`

I used the **Table Data Import Wizard** for this process.  

As I began exploring each table, I noticed something odd in the `order_details` table ‚Äî  
the **date** and **time** columns were imported as **text** instead of proper `DATE` and `TIME` data types.  

At first, I thought of deleting the table and re-importing it.  
But then I realized this was a great chance to **practice some SQL data cleaning** üß†.  

Here‚Äôs how I went about it:

---

#### üîç Step 1: Explore the data  

```sql
SELECT *
FROM order_details;
```
---

#### üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Add a new column

I created a new column called new_order_date with the correct data type:
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_details
ADD COLUMN new_order_date DATE;
```
---

#### üîÑ Step 3: Convert and update the data

Then I filled this column by converting the existing order_date text into a proper date format:
```sql
UPDATE order_details
SET new_order_date = STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%c/%e/%y');
```
---


#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify the conversion 

I did a few random checks comparing the old and new columns to make sure the conversion worked correctly

---


#### üßπ Step 5: Drop and rename columns

Once everything looked good, I replaced the old column with the cleaned one:
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_details
DROP COLUMN order_date;

ALTER TABLE order_details
RENAME COLUMN new_order_date TO order_date;
```
This small mistake turned into a valuable data cleaning exercise ‚Äî
A reminder that not every dataset comes clean, and sometimes the best learning happens when you fix the mess yourself

---

#### üîÑ Step 6: Repeat with order_time column

I did the same thing with order_time column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_details
ADD COLUMN new_order_time TIME;

UPDATE order_details
SET new_order_time = str_to_date(order_time, '%h:%i:%s %p');

ALTER TABLE order_details
DROP COLUMN order_time;

ALTER TABLE order_details
RENAME COLUMN new_order_time TO order_time;
```

## Objective 1: üçΩÔ∏è Explore the `menu_items` table - Data Exploration ‚Äì Understanding the Menu

After cleaning the order_details table, I moved on to exploring what‚Äôs on the new menu.
The menu_items table contains all the dishes offered at Taste of the World Caf√© ‚Äî including their categories, cuisines, and prices.

```sql
-- 1. View the menu_tem table.
SELECT * from menu_items;

-- 2. Find the number of items on the menu.
SELECT COUNT(*) from menu_items AS num_menu_items;
-- 32 menu items


-- 3. What are the TOP 3 least and most expensive items on the menu?
SELECT * from menu_items
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 3;
-- Edamame, Mac & Cheese, French Fries


SELECT * from menu_items
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;
-- Shrimp Scampi, Korean Beef Bowl, Pork Ramen


-- 4. How many Italian dishes are on the menu?
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS num_item
FROM menu_items
WHERE category = "Italian";
-- 9 dishes


-- 5. What are the TOP 3 least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu?
-- least expansive
SELECT * from menu_items
WHERE category = "Italian"
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 3;
-- Spaghetti, Fettuccine Alfredo, Cheese Lasagna


-- most expensive
SELECT * from menu_items
WHERE category = "Italian"
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;
-- Shrimp Scampi, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Meat Lasagna


-- 6. How many dishes are in each category?
SELECT category, count(item_name) AS num_dishes
FROM menu_items
GROUP BY category;
-- American: 6, Asian: 8, Mexican: 9,Italian: 9


-- 7. What is the average dish price within each category?
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM menu_items
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_price;
-- American: 10.07, Mexican: 11.8, Asian: 13.48, Italian: 16.75

```
üí° These queries give a quick but powerful overview of the restaurant‚Äôs new menu ‚Äî highlighting pricing patterns, cuisine variety, and category-level insights.

## Objective 2: Explore the `order_details` table - understand what kind of data has been collected

```sql
-- 1. View the order_details table.
SELECT * 
FROM order_details;

-- 2. What is the date range of the table?
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date)
FROM order_details;
-- 2023-01-01 --> 2023-03-31 (3 months)


-- 3. How many orders were made within this date range?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
FROM order_details;
-- 5370 orders


-- 4. How many items were ordered within this date range?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM order_details;
-- 12,234 items ordered

-- 5. Which orders had the most number of items?
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY num_items DESC;
-- 14 items per order: 330, 440, 443, 1957, 2675, 3473, 4305, 4482


-- 6. How many orders had more than 12 items?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders FROM
(SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING num_items > 12
ORDER BY num_items DESC) AS num_orders;
-- 23 orders 
```

After all the questions have been aswered, I tinker around the data to find out if I can summarize the data into a quick summary table:
```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders,
COUNT(*) AS total_items,
MIN(order_date) AS start_date,
MAX(order_date) AS end_date
FROM order_details;
```

I also want to find out the trend of customers by date or over time:
```sql
SELECT order_date, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;
```
---

## Objective 3: Combine the order_details and menu_items Tables
Goal: Understand what customers are ordering and identify popular items, revenue drivers, and patterns.

```sql
-- 1. Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table.
SELECT * 
FROM menu_items;

SELECT * 
FROM order_details;

SELECT * 
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;


-- 2. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?

-- Least ordered items
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_order, category
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name, category
ORDER BY num_order;
-- chicken tacos: total to 123 orders only

-- Most ordered items
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_order, category
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name, category
ORDER BY num_order DESC;
-- Hamburger is the most ordered items


-- 3. What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_price
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_price DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- order_id: 440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675


-- 4. View the details of the highest spend order. What insights can you gather from the results?
-- extract all orders from the highest spend order, order: 440
SELECT *
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440;

-- get the catagory of orders and the total of spend in the catagory
SELECT category, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_order, sum(price) total_price
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_price DESC;
-- Insight gather: Most of the order‚Äôs total spend came from the Italian category ‚Äî showing a strong preference for Italian cuisine among high spenders.


-- 5. View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders. What insights can you gather from the results?
SELECT order_id, category, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_order, sum(price) total_price
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi 
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675)
GROUP BY order_id, category
ORDER BY total_price DESC;
-- insight gather: Across all top-spending customers, Italian dishes consistently dominate ‚Äî confirming their role as the caf√©‚Äôs biggest revenue driver.
```
